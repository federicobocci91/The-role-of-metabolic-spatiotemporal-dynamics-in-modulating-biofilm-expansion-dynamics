# The-role-of-metabolic-spatiotemporal-dynamics-in-modulating-biofilm-expansion-dynamics

The file biofilm.cpp is a clean version of the code used for the numerical solution of the model presented in Bocci, Suzuki, Lu, Onuchic. "The role of metabolic spatiotemporal dynamics in modulating biofilm expasion dynamics".

To execute the file, enter your local repository and type (i) $: g++ biofilm.cpp to create the executable a.out, then (ii) $: ./a.out to execute the file. It will generate a .txt file (data.txt) containing the data of the biofilm radius and growth rate. 
You can access and plot the data.txt file with you favourite plotting software/library.
